        <p>This isn't a project obviously but it's cool enough to include.  Apparently there's no such thing as a crochet machine.  Only knitting can be machine 
            replicated and anything crocheted must be handmade. Kinda feelin' superior to knitters rn B) <a href="https://learn-how-to-crochet.com/why-cant-crochet-be-done-by-a-machine/">https://learn-how-to-crochet.com/why-cant-crochet-be-done-by-a-machine/</a>

        <h3>Cugel the Clever</h3>
        <p>My first project with DK yarn because I wanted it to be pocked sized.  Took me around 20 hours and I had to make the tunic twice to get it right.  Based on my favorite character from the Dying Earth book saga.</p>
