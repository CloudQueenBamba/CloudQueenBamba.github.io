            <p>This is basically an exaggerated version of my tendancy to "escape" to my head when I'm unsatisfied with certain aspects of my life.  I've wasted too much time lying in 
                bed for hours imagining elaborate worlds and plotlines, and fantasizing about people that don't even exist.  This one might come off as cringe/pretentious at times but I actually cared
                about it and really tried to match it to my feelings towards the subject.
            </p>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvOPA_clTLRD5QWG6Bj9QwHJcQR6H3oSmX74tsNXKZ8/edit?usp=sharing"><h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Last Angel of Earth</h3></a>
            <p>A demon is sent to earth during the apocalypse to seek out and corrupt the few humans who haven't succumbed to complete sin. He sets his sights on a girl named 
                Elise, and is tasked with uncovering her vulnerabilities and flaws through any means necessary. But with him being incoporeal, they can never speak to or see each other.
                <br> This is literally demon romance btw so if you're religious you probably won't want to read it lol... sorry ik it's bad</p>
