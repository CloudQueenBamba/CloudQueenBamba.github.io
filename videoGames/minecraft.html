        <p>-Anyone can join.  If you're reading this right now youre invited.</p>
        <p>-Vanilla version 1.20.2 Java Edition</p>
        <p>-Cracked accounts welcome, the server is in offline mode.  Unfortunately this means nobody will have their custom player skin.  This isn't a bug, it's just how offline servers work :(
        </p>
        <p>-This is a self-hosted server from my apartment so connection might not be great.  I have a cheap internet plan lol.  If the server is completely down for more than a day though lmk

        <h2 style="color: rgb(252, 152, 103);">Rules (or lack thereof)</h2>
        <p>I'm going off a trust system that everyone is kind and capable of common sense, so I'm not going to be enforcing any "official rules" for the server because I think that restricts gameplay.
            That being said, if people start abusing this and I see griefed builds or get complaints, I will start making hard rules.  Pleeeaase use common sense and 
            don't do anything that would harm other player's experiences.  You're not being funny or edgy, you're just forcing me to add anti cheat/grief plugins 
            that I would rather not have, both for the sake of keeping it easy on me, and making the experience better on other players.
